// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
// 
// Correct Answer: 232_792_560

fun gcd(x, y) {
    loop y {
        tmp <- x;
        x = y;
        y = tmp % y;
    }

    return x;
}

result <- 1;

i <- 1;
loop i <= 20; i = i + 1 {
    result = result * (i / gcd(i, result));
}

print result;
